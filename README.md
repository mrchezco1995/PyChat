# PyChat
A Python-based Messenger

## What is PyChat? 
PyChat is a messenger written in Python 2.7 and utilizes TKinter for its GUI. This uses User Data Protocol or UDP as its connection method. It's intended to be multiplatform but since this some libs that only works for Windows (pywin32), this works only on Windows for now (you can remove pywin32 stuffs and replace it with other libs or remove it completely from the code to make it work on other platforms thou...).

## Prerequesites
PyChat requires the following libs: 
- Python 2.7
- pywin32
- Python Image Library (PIL)

##Bugs
PyChat had some minor bugs like online clients doesn't refresh when a user disconnect, which make you think a user in question is online but its not... It also had some minor bugs when configuring user settings or account settings too... You'll see... That's all of the bugs I know so far for this code XD 

##SNEK
Yeah... Sneks.... SNEK!!!!!!!!!!!! XD
